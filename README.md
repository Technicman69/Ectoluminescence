# Ectoluminescence
![icon.gif](icon.gif)

or "Ectolum" for short

It's a mod that gives more purposes to a few of features already existing in vanilla minecraft, including: **Glow Ink Sac, Phantom Membrane and Echo Shard**.
Ideas for these features were taken, with the consent of the creator, from youtube video ['I Fixed "USELESS" Minecraft Features'](https://youtu.be/lYRpvjmH6Q8) by Nekoma (Note, that the mod only includes ideas for items listed above).

# Features:
1. Using **Glow Ink Sac** on a block causes:
   - **Banner** patterns to glow
   - **Decorated Pot** sherd symbols to glow
2. Using **Phantom Membrane** on a block causes:
   - **Banner** background to disappear, so only the patterns can be seen
   - **Sign** background to disappear, with only the text visible
3. New items:
   - **Clear Item Frame** - A semi transparent Item Frame, that becomes invisible once you put an item inside. Perfect for creating displays with the Item visible, without the unnecessary texture of an Item Frame underneath! It's crafted from one Item Frame and one Glow Ink Sac.
   - **Glow Torch** - A waterloggable version of torch, that glows worse than Soul Torch on the surface, but also glows as bright as a torch when placed underwater. Crafted from Glow Ink Sac and a stick.

**Full preview of features listed above is avaible in the gallery :>**

### Echoing Effect: Pigment
